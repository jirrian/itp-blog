I made a simple webapp that recognizes if you are showing it a teddy bear. The webpage asks you to show the bear and when it recognizes it, it thanks you. I adapted the [ml5 p5.js image classification video example](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples/tree/master/p5js/ImageClassification/ImageClassification_Video).

My code looks for the "teddy, teddy bear" result, but you could change this any of the other results that are available.
