I combined assignments from Computational Approaches to Typography and Machine Learning for the Web. For this project, I made an asemic writing generator that responds to user-set gestures.

I was inspired by this work by Cecil Touchon. I wanted to experiment with writing the 'text' in a pleasing graphic layout.
I broke down the asemic text generation into 4 elements:
- writing strokes
- long writing strokes
- spaces
- new line and carriage return
Each of these actions correspond to a gesture that can be set by the user.
