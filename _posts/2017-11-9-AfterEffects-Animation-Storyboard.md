[Haiyi Huang](http://www.haiyihuangblog.com/){:target="_blank"} and I are creating a music video for the song 'someone brand new (feat. ammi)' by [fi](https://soundcloud.com/fairywyng){:target="_blank"}. Fionna and I have talked about her music before on twitter so I was really excited she was open to us creating a visualization for her music.

The lyrics were written by and provided by the featured singer in the track, ammi. They are about healing and moving on from an old relationship to the possibility of starting a new one with someone else.

We are using a combination of hand-drawn assets in Sketch-Up and cutouts from old scientific books and guides.
