title: "3D Print Final: New Concept and Models"

After thinking about how to make my glasses frames more 3-dimensional, I decided to change my concept and 3d print fake press-on nails. I want to make them fit over my nails so I will need to make around 5 different sizes.

I did some research to see if anyone had did this before and made it work and found [this](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/thelasergirls){target="_blank"}. I think I can make designs that are more 3-dimensional and less representational.

I'm still experimenting with designs and fit. For this week, I wanted to experiment with fitting the shapes around my fingers; however, I was unable to find a time slot where a 3d-printer was open. So, I started making some possible designs. I want to make my final design more extreme than the ones below.
