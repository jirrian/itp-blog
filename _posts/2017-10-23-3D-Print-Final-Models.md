title: "3D Print Final: New Concept and Models"

After thinking about how to make my glasses frames more 3-dimensional, I decided to change my concept and 3d print fake press-on nails. I'm doing this because I used to have really long natural nails that I painted every week. My nails have broken from doing physical work and are crusty from not having time to do them because of ITP. Ideally, I want to make the fake nails fit over my short natural nails so I will need to make around 5 different sizes.

I did some research to see if anyone had did this before and made it work and found [this](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/thelasergirls){target="_blank"}. I think I can make designs that are more 3-dimensional and less representational.

Took me a while to figure out how to even model a plain fake nail. My first models failed to print because they were too thin.

I'm still experimenting with designs and fit. For this week, I wanted to experiment with fitting the shapes around my fingers; however, I was unable to find a time slot where a 3d-printer was open after improving my plain nail models. So, I started making some possible designs. I want to make my final design more extreme than the one below.
