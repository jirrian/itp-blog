##### Soundwalk Reaction #####

I did the [Passing Stranger](http://eastvillagepoetrywalk.org/) soundwalk on a sunny Tuesday afternoon. The tour is documentary style, detailing the history of East Village poets while grounding their work into the physical places they lived, collaborated, and performed. 

The added street sounds and music seemingly transported me back into the East Village during the time of the poets. The East Village today is drastically different, and still changing; the shift of demographics and gentrification of the area was also mentioned in the soundtour. You would think that it is pointless to physically walk to the mentioned stops because it now looks completely different; however, it was interesting to learn the historical context of places I've been to before. My familiar hang out spots and past commute byways were transformed, as if I had traveled back in time. 

The variety in narration voices kept me engaged. There was consistentancy to the narration: the same voice for directions, the same voice for narration. The different expressive voices for the poetry readings kept the audio fresh.

I learned of Philip Larkin and his poem "This Be The Verse" from the following Supreme sweatshirt:
