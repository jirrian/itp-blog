Media informs our perceptions of others and ourselves.
It is representative of a society’s ideals while also imposing ideals onto it.
This is a cartoon called my life as a teenage robot. Watching this as a kid, I always thought the main character was chinese american llike me despite her generally being depicted as a ‘raceless’ robot.
i related to this character so much bc like me, she struggled to adapt to the social norms of suburban white culture.

On the other side, in science fictions movies like ex machina, asian women are presented as servile objects, simultaneously providing sexual titillation and othering body horror to viewers.
There is an interesting tension there that has been floating around my mind since that i’ve been trying to decode.
