## Thesis Presentation ##
What follows is an edited transcript of my original thesis presentation titled "Person Thing #1-3: Explorations of a Cyborg" from May 2019. *Work in Progress*

For my thesis, I’ve created art pieces exploring the elusive gray area in between “thing” and “person”. 
More specifically, I’m playing with the visual languages established in western culture used to depict people that are racialized and gendered as east asian women or “the yellow woman”.

Media informs our perceptions of others and ourselves.
It is representative of a society’s ideals while also imposing ideals onto it.
This is a cartoon called my life as a teenage robot. Watching this as a kid, I always thought the main character was chinese american llike me despite her generally being depicted as a ‘raceless’ robot.
i related to this character so much bc like me, she struggled to adapt to the social norms of suburban white culture.

On the other side, in science fictions movies like ex machina, asian women are presented as servile objects, simultaneously providing sexual titillation and othering body horror to viewers.
There is an interesting tension there that has been floating around my mind since that i’ve been trying to decode.

I may have always been thinking about my own experiences as a marginalized person in some form but it wasnt until i read “ornamentalism” by anne anlin cheng where i saw a framework clearly laid out for the underlying system in how east asian women are racialized and gendered.

We are familiar with the idea of orientalism and it’s impact on images of non european people throughout history. We are also familiar with east asian motifs, ornaments appearing throughout western visual culture with or without east asian people. 

This is a long and enduring tradition and it most interestingly, it suggests that
> Asiatic femininity in the Western racial imagination does not need to pass through the biological or the natural in order to acquire its most palpable, fully sensorial, supple, and vibrant presence (Cheng).

Although we are familiar with these concepts and may hear it discussed as “Oriental female objectification” “… we barely know how to process the political, racial, and ontic complications of confronting a human figure that emerges as and through ornament” (Cheng).

A cyborg or a cybernetic organism is a being with both organic and mechanical body parts. 
It’s often evoked in science fiction to talk about ideas such as human vs machine or human vs object.
Cheng uses the metaphor of a cyborg to describe the how east asian women are racialized and gendered.

So, “Asiatic femininity has always been prosthetic” (Cheng).

>The dream of the yellow woman subsumes a dream about the inorganic. She is an, if not the, original cyborg (Cheng).

I decided to focus on cyborg imagery because of my interest in science fiction, my own background in computer science, and the rising influence of techno-orientalism.

After *Ornamentalism*'s release, I came across this tweet by curator and writer Danie Wu.

So with my background studying computer science, I thought “Who better to create cyborgs than a cyborg herself?” While designing and building this project, I positioned myself as a cyborg creating cyborgs.

#####Person Thing #1-3 is a series of experiments where I create representations of east asian women (or myself) in artificial objects and examine my relationship with my creations.#####

Can I better understand the blurry line between person and thing and the visual language that drives it?

Will I see my creations as another object? Or as a clone of myself? A new separate being?

Person Thing is a series of three pieces. 
I designed these ideas around experimenting with different forms of representation. From physical to virtual to sound and text based.
I originally proposed three pieces and was told at midterms that it was “ambitious” and decided to go through with it. Right now, I’ve only completed 2 of them. So, I will talk more about these 2 in this presentation.

Why a series and in different mediums?
