I started with a detailed pencil drawing going off of a photo of myself. I then drew the subsequent portraits using the idea of myself in my head. I switched to a thick permanent marker since I thought it would be easier to simplify my drawings if I could only draw thick, dark lines. I found this exercise challenging since I think my facial features (eyes, nose, lips) are equally prominent. I also found it hard to draw my nose shape without shading at first. I focused on my eyebrows throughout the process because I think how I do my eyebrow makeup is a little over the top and humorous (since I like it really straight and dark).
