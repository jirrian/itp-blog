I worked on this installation with [Defne](https://defneonenitp.tumblr.com/tagged/videosculptures). The assignment was to create a video portrait that "give[s] us an idea of the person or persons". We were inspired by the personal and individualistic nature of people's notebooks.

For the filming, I asked people at ITP if they were willing to have their notebooks filmed. They were instructed to flip through their own notebook however they liked.

Defne edited the footage together into one video. Then it was projected with a PICO projector on a blank notebook that was taped open. We used MadMapper to map the projection onto the notebook.
