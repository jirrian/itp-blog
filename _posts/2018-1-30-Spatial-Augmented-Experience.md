I've been sick for the past month which really reduced my appetite. This made me sad since eating meals is usually one the highlights of my day. So, I decided to augment a plate with a projection of food. I thought I could simulate some of the enjoyable aspects of eating a meal such as sitting in front of a delicious looking plate without having to actually eat it.

#### Process ####
I started by finding a video with soondubu jjigae (soft tofu stew) in it. I downloaded [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tpycbDX_Q){:target="_blank"} off of youtube and added a mask around the dish.

Then I connected the projector ([aaxa android led projector](http://aaxatech.com/products/led_showtime_android_projector.html){:target="_blank"}) and tested on different plates and bowls.

I settled on the white porcelain plate because it was white colored and has a flat surface which allowed for the projection to show up and not be distorted. It would make more sense if the stew was projected onto a bowl so in an ideally I would have a flat white paper fit to the top opening of a bowl or pot.
This experience is not interactive. If I had a motion sensor, I could change the video to show less stew after the user moves a spoon over it, simulating eating.
