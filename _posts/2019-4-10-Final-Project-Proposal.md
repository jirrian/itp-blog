#### Three word description ####
synthetic, grotesque, vulnerable

#### One sentence description ####
A virtual sculpture of a ghostly person-thing that is comes to life in augmented reality.

#### Full description of the proposed project ####
A ghostly human-scale 3D figure is placed on the ground in augmented reality. The figure is idley standing but turns to face the user if they walk closer.

This figure is a 3D model made of synthetic and exaggerated body parts. It is made from combining 3D models of robots and anime figures readily downloadable from the internet.

#### Concept ####
I want the viewer to experience an eery feeling from seeing a breathing, human-sized figure at an intimate distance that is unhuman and unnatural in appearance. I also want the viewer to feel confusion with the combination of humanlike movements and a mechanical, synthetic avatar. 

#### Why is this concept a meaningful exploration of video sculpture? ####

#### Plan for installation ####
