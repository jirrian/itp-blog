title: Paper and Metal Diamond Ring
categories: introfab
---
Note: I didn't have time to fix the comments section on my blog this week. I'll try to figure it out for next week.

I wanted to use paper and metal wire to create a design inspired by a diamond ring. I used paper for the gem stone part and metal as the holder/jewelry part. Figuring out the process and design took me a long time and many tries. Basically, I learned that I hate working with paper and I'm really bad at soldering.

Originally, I thought that I could construct a paper diamond using origami. I printed out a diamond design onto paper and cut it into a square.
