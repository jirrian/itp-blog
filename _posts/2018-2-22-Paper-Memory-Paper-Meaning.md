[Paper Memory Paper Meaning](https://jzhong.today/papermemorypapermeaning/){:target="_blank"}

I was interested in the prompt 'what can a card be?' and also how we attribute meaning to tarot cards based on imagery and conventional understandings.

In the future, I would like to add more 'cards' and maybe add functionality for other users to add their own 'cards' and memories. I'm unsure if there is more meaning in using your own papers and memories (personal relevance) or using a pool of all users' memories (conventionalized meanings).
