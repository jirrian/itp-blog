I'm working on this garment as a part of my thesis where I will be creating other "yellow" women (East Asian women) using race making technologies and Western visual culture/language and exploring my relations with them/myself.

I was greatly inspired by the Alexander McQueen for Givenchy F/W 1999 collection's transparent, hard body suits with LEDS. I was also inspired by the modular nature of Paco Rabanne dresses. These made me choose to use acrylic to build a hard top that suggests a body even when the garment is not worn by anyone. [For more inspirations, see my are.na board](https://www.are.na/jillian-zhong/robotic-futuristic-tech-fetishistic-garment-design){:target="_blank"}.
