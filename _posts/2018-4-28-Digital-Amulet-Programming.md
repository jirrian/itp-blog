title: "Digital Amulet Part Two: Programming"
categories: electronicrituals

This project was a combination of my finals for Homemade Hardware and Electronic Rituals. While reading personal posts on instagram, I realized that I often commented the phrase 'sending love' when I wanted to show my support for that person. In a way, through our connections on social media, we give each other protection and support. An amulet is an item that traditionally gives its wearer protection and good luck. I wanted to make an amulet that received its power through the internet.

#### Programming the ESP8266 Module ####
It was such a challenge to finally be able to flash code to my module!! I used this [USB to TTL Serial Converter with a CP2102](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072K3Z3TL).
