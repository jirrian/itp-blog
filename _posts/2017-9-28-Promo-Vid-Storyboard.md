In our globalized world, we constantly encounter communication challenges. We all have had disagreements in our personal and professional life. Increasingly, we meet and work with people who come from different background and cultures. How do we effectively talk with one another? We have a solution for you! Introducing Mindmailer - a easy solution to all of your communication problems! Just put a Mindmelder (pending) patch on, and you can be in sync with the people around you. 
This is our project idea - Mindmelder, a product for communication.
