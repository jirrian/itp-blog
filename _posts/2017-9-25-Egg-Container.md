The concept is an egg shaped container that has a bottom and a lid.

I started by drawing 2 parallel curves and revolving it around an axis.

I then hollowed out the middle using the 2 egg solids, making it empty inside.
Then I drew a plane from a curve and extruded it. I used BooleanSplit to separate the halves from each other.
