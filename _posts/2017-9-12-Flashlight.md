At first, I designed my concept around a bright light either inside of an empty plastic gallon water/milk jug or held directly against the outside. The main point was that the sharp LED light would be diffused by the frosted plastic of the standard jug.

However, after having this cool drink at Starbucks, I realized I could use the plastic cup it came in instead.
