#### Digital Presentation ####
I want to try using instagram's list view as a way to display and read comics. I chose this because I also want to incorporate actual photographs of the food in a way that the reader is already familiar with. As the reader scrolls down on the account I will make for this comic, they will be able to read the story.

Sample of panel layout:

I want the illustrated panels to showcase the surrounding neighborhood and restaurant interiors so I will have many moment to moment transitions.
I'm still undecided on what style to do the illustrated panels in. I'm considering hand drawing and then scanning into illustrator to finish + add text. But I might also want to try drawing digitally for the first time? Maybe I will use photographs that are muted for all the backgrounds and just draw the people.
