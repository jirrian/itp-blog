Interaction is whenever a user does an action onto something (another user, a program, object, etc.) and receives meaningful feedback. There should be a loop in which the first user processes the feedback and then makes a decision and commits an action again. The feedback should be detailed enough that the user has to be mentally engaged to process it.
