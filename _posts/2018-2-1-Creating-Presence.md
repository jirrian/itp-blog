I worked with Erin and Yuan for this assignment. We attempted to make the user feel that they are very close to a volcano.

#### Components ####
The visual component is a 360 video from inside a volcano. It was ripped from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBp2EWPjotk){:target="_blank"} from youtube. It was then run on an android phone using [VR Media Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xojot.vrplayer&hl=en){:target="_blank"} and Google cardboard. The user has to hold the cardboard to their face to use it.

The audio component is sounds of a volcano downloaded online separately. It was played on wireless headphones which the user was asked to wear.

Other components involved heat. We asked the user to take off their shoes and stand on a heat pad. We also blew a hot hair dryer at the user's face from the direction of the center of the volcano.

#### User Testing ####
