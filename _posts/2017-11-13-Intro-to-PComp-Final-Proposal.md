#### Not My Turn to Speak ####
My final idea is to create a "wearable" that reacts to myself and people around me. I want to fabricate a headpiece based on a theatre curtain. A headband will support a metal track around the my head. The curtain will be attached to this track. There will be 2 directional microphones, one pointed at me (the wearer) and one pointed away. When the I speak, the curtain will close over my face, muffling my voice. If the fabric is not enough to muffle my voice, I may have speakers start to play music. When someone speaks to me, the curtain will open, allowing people to look at me and speak to me.

#### Research ####
I'm looking at examples of simple motorized curtains with Arduino as well as professional home curtain systems. I want my track to be circular so I will probably have to use a belt on a curved track. The fabric will be attached to parts of the belt.
